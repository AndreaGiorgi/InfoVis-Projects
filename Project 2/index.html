    <h1 class="page-title">Radiation levels in a week interval <br/> obtained from <br/> norwegian government data<br/></h1>
    <div class="top-summary">
        <p>Radiation level monitoring became of major importance after the Chernobyl events of 1986 and more so after the Fukushima events of 2011. 
            The Norwegian government, as well as the Swedish, Danish and Finnish governments, 
            monitors radiation levels throughout the country on a daily basis throughout various monitoring stations.
            Attention to this issue has increased starting from 22/23 June 2020, when monitoring stations detected abnormal 
            levels of several radiactive elements like cesium-134, cesium-137, cobalt-60 and ruthenium-103 
            <a href= 'https://www.sciencealert.com/unexpected-radiation-spike-detected-over-europe-authorities-say'>(source)</a> 
            in the North and Norwegian sea.
          </p>
          <p>The following set of visualizations utilize radiation data derived from DSA <br/>Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority. 
            Each daily data has been aggregated by each county showing the daily radiation change on a two week range of observation. 
            The data is taken directly from the DSA Open Data, carefully engineered and later visualized. <br/>
          </p>
          <p>For more information about the data used in this visualization project, the data is stored on <a href="https://github.com/AndreaGiorgi/InfoVis-Projects/tree/main/Project%202">Github</a> alongside with the source code.</p>

        <p>From the visual representation showed above we can clearly see that the radiation levels during mid-July fits inside a normal behavior. 
            The variation of data isnâ€™t containing outliners, the only exception is in the county of Troms og Finnmark where there is a notable rise in radiations level 
            in a single day. Radiation analysis makes it possible to carry out major studies on the incidence of diseases in local fauna and in humans with particular 
            attention to those diseases that can lead to the onset of malignant or benign tumors.

        <p> Norway, Finland, Sweden and Denmark are nations bordering either the North Sea or the Baltic Sea or the Norwegian Sea. 
            These seas are also used by other nations, such as Russia, for the transport of goods and resources or for experiments, both military and civil, within international waters. In the event that some of these experiments are of a nuclear nature,
            a possible release of radiation would be detected and would allow adequate decisions to be made, from a simple statement to extreme cases, the distribution of iodine to the population.

            it will be possible to view the level of radiation throughout the entire observation period.
